<h2> Working Demonstration </h2>

<img src="./Assets/demo.gif" />

<p>
  I have used Haar Cascade Classifier and Wavelet Transform to detect faces in the images.  Then after preprocessing the datasets, I tested my model on various classifiers(SVM, Logistic Regression,Random Forest). Then I have used the best performing model to predict the names of the faces detected in the images.
